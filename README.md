# Classification-

<h2>Classification of simplified digits and faces using Naive Bayes and Perceptron<h2>
  <p>In this project we first attempt to classify individual digits constructed out of ascii characters (think MNIST but simplified with fewer points to consider). 
  For this we use Naive Bayes and Perceptron. <p>
  <p>Next we attempt to classify simple ascii art faces (think image post edge detection and with fewer points to consider). We use the same classifiers but with adjusted features and again notice a high degree of success. <p>
